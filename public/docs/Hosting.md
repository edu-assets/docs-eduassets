# EduAssets hosting and operations

> **Product version: official 1.2.0 (November 12, 2026).** The record below describes the topology observed on October 23, 2026; it is not a check of remote infrastructure at the time you read this guide.

## 1. Deployed topology

The deployment uses three distinct hostnames:

- `eduassets.tech`: an independent landing page hosted by another Cloudflare project;
- `app.eduassets.tech`: the static EduAssets frontend hosted on Cloudflare Pages;
- `api.eduassets.tech`: the Node.js/Express backend running in Docker on an Oracle Cloud Ubuntu VM;
- `docs.eduassets.tech`: public Markdown documentation served by its dedicated Cloudflare Pages project.

PostgreSQL remains remote on Neon. The VM has only 1 GB of RAM, so it does not host the database locally.

```

Port `3000` must not be exposed to the Internet. Docker publishes the API only on `127.0.0.1:3000`; Nginx is the VM's public service.

## 2. Prerequisites

The VM requires Ubuntu, Docker Engine with Docker Compose, Nginx, UFW, and administrative SSH access. Cloudflare requires the `eduassets.tech` zone, the frontend Pages project, and the API DNS record.

Use a protected environment file on the VM:

```bash
cd /opt/api-eduassets
chmod 600 .env.production
```

The essential production values are:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=<Neon URL, never document the real value>
JWT_SECRET=<strong secret, VM only>
CORS_ORIGIN=https://app.eduassets.tech
TRUST_PROXY=1
RFID_BRIDGE_ENABLED=false
```

`CORS_ORIGIN` must exactly match the frontend origin, without a trailing slash. Never copy `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, passwords, tokens, or keys into Git, documentation, or `VITE_*` variables.

## 3. Cloudflare Pages configuration

In the frontend Pages project:

1. Repository: `edu-assets/app-eduassets`.
2. Production branch: `main`.
3. Root directory: `/` (repository root).
4. Build command: `npm run build`.
5. Output directory: `dist`.
6. Public build-time variables:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.eduassets.tech
VITE_RFID_BRIDGE_ENABLED=false
```

7. Custom domain: `app.eduassets.tech`.

The browser app fetches its Markdown from an immutable docs commit pinned in `src/core/docs/docsService.ts` via `raw.githubusercontent.com`. `docs.eduassets.tech` remains the public guide site; it is not the app's default fetch host. `public/_headers` is copied to `dist/_headers`. The production CSP must allow the API, the pinned docs origin, the official Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon and Google Analytics:

```text
script-src 'self' https://static.cloudflareinsights.com https://*.googletagmanager.com
img-src 'self' data: https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.googletagmanager.com
connect-src 'self' https://api.eduassets.tech https://docs.eduassets.tech https://raw.githubusercontent.com https://cloudflareinsights.com https://*.google-analytics.com https://*.analytics.google.com https://*.googletagmanager.com
```

The Analytics beacon was blocked when the policy contained only `script-src 'self'`. The policy allows no inline scripts: Google Analytics (`G-9LJ1MQRCEV`) is loaded by an app module (`src/core/analytics/analyticsConsent.ts`) **only after consent** in the cookie banner; without consent, no Google script is requested. The address sent to Google never includes fragments carrying values, such as the password recovery link. The `eduassets.tech` website uses the same mechanism (`src/scripts/analytics-consent.ts`) and an equivalent CSP. The app CI fails if the CSP stops allowing Google Analytics or starts accepting `'unsafe-inline'`. The privacy and cookie policies describe this processing (§16). After changing `_headers`, wait for a new Pages deployment and perform a hard refresh in the browser.

## 4. DNS and TLS

The canonical API record is:

```text
Type: A
Name: api
Content: <current public IP of the Oracle VM>
Proxy status: Proxied
```

The VM's public origin IP is intentionally omitted from this guide. Retrieve the current value from the authorized infrastructure inventory when an approved DNS change requires it; do not include the origin address in public documentation.

Keep one record for `api.eduassets.tech`; remove duplicate records for the same hostname. `app` and the apex domain may continue to point to their respective Cloudflare projects.

Use **Full (strict)** in Cloudflare when the matching origin certificate for `api.eduassets.tech` is installed in Nginx. Never publish the private certificate key.

## 5. Start and update the API

The production API is managed by Compose, not by `npm run dev`:

```bash
cd /opt/api-eduassets

docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  ps
```

Start a stopped container:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  up -d api
```

The abbreviated command below is only for code/configuration changes **without a database migration**. If a release includes a schema migration, follow the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md): verify a backup, explicitly run the `migrate` service, and only then start/update the API. CI validates code and runs smoke checks against disposable infrastructure; it does not publish to Cloudflare or deploy to the Oracle VM.

After `git pull` or an environment change without migrations:

```bash
git pull --ff-only origin main

docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  up -d --build --force-recreate api
```

After changing only `.env.production`, recreation is still required:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  up -d --force-recreate api
```

Confirm that the container received the correct origin:

```bash
docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  exec api printenv CORS_ORIGIN
```

Expected output:

```text
https://app.eduassets.tech
```

Migrations and seeding are explicit operations. Never seed an unknown or production database without a backup and review. The API must not run migrations automatically at startup.

### 5.1 Automatic API deployment (pull on the VM)

Since v1.2.0 the VM can deploy the API by itself: [`auto-deploy.sh`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/scripts/auto-deploy.sh), triggered every 5 minutes by `eduassets-deploy.timer`, fetches `main` and acts only when `origin/main` moved forward **and** the CI jobs `verify` and `production-smoke` passed for that exact commit (a public GitHub API query; no inbound port is opened and no VM key is stored in GitHub). The sequence is:

1. fast-forward the checkout (diverged history or local changes are refused);
2. build the image tagged with the commit's `git rev-parse --short=12`;
3. only when the release adds migrations: an encrypted backup (`run-scheduled-backup.sh`) and an explicit run of the `migrate` service — if either fails, the API is not touched;
4. `up -d --no-build --force-recreate api` and a wait of up to 180 s for `healthy` + `/ready`;
5. success: the commit is appended to `/var/lib/eduassets-deploy/history` and old images are removed, keeping the current and previous ones;
6. failure: the checkout and container return to the previous commit/image and the commit is written to `/var/lib/eduassets-deploy/failed-sha`, which is not retried (`vm-health-check.sh` reports the failure until a new push or until that file is removed).

Rolling back code/images **does not revert migrations**: keep migrations compatible with the previous version (expand/migrate/contract), as in the Deployment Guide. Activation (once, as root):

```bash
cd /opt/api-eduassets
git pull --ff-only origin main
install -m 600 deploy/systemd/deploy.env.example /etc/eduassets/deploy.env   # optional; review the values
install -m 644 deploy/systemd/eduassets-deploy.service deploy/systemd/eduassets-deploy.timer /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now eduassets-deploy.timer
journalctl -u eduassets-deploy -n 30 --no-pager
```

To pause automatic deployment: `systemctl disable --now eduassets-deploy.timer`. To retry a commit that failed: `rm /var/lib/eduassets-deploy/failed-sha`.

### 5.2 Password recovery email (Brevo)

Self-service password recovery sends the link over SMTP. Without the four required variables below the feature is disabled (the **Forgot my password** link is hidden and the endpoint answers `503`); a partial configuration stops the API from starting. The API is not tied to a provider: any SMTP server with TLS works (port `465` uses implicit TLS; other ports use mandatory STARTTLS). In production mail is sent through **Brevo** (free plan), while the domain mailbox stays on **Zoho Mail**, used only for receiving. In `.env.production`:

```bash
APP_PUBLIC_URL=https://app.eduassets.tech
SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP_PORT=587                                   # STARTTLS
SMTP_USER=<SMTP login shown in Brevo → SMTP & API>
SMTP_PASS=<SMTP key generated in Brevo>         # secret: never commit it or paste it into chats
MAIL_FROM="eduAssets <nao-responda@eduassets.tech>"
SUPPORT_EMAIL=dasilva-thiago@eduassets.tech     # optional: footer contact and Reply-To
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://eduassets.tech          # optional: website link in the footer
```

**Brevo setup (once):**

1. **Senders, domains & IPs → Domains:** authenticate `eduassets.tech` (`TXT` `brevo-code:…` at the apex, `CNAME` `brevo1._domainkey` and `brevo2._domainkey` for Brevo's DKIM, and the `_dmarc` record described in §15).
2. **Branded subdomain `em`:** `CNAME` `em`, `r.em` (tracked-link redirects) and `img.em` (images), all **DNS only** in Cloudflare. Brevo issues the HTTPS certificate for `r.em.eduassets.tech` on its own; until it does, tracked links in the email open with a certificate error (see the record in §14).
3. **Senders:** add `nao-responda@eduassets.tech`. The mailbox exists in Zoho Mail (free plan, no SMTP/IMAP) only to receive Brevo's verification and any replies.
4. **Security → Authorized IPs:** with the IP allowlist on, add the VM's public IP; otherwise Brevo rejects the SMTP login.
5. **SMTP & API:** generate the SMTP key and store it only in `.env.production` (mode `0600`).

Brevo rewrites the links in the email to record clicks (`https://r.em.eduassets.tech/tr/cl/…`) and redirects to the original target, keeping the `#redefinir-senha=…` fragment; the dashboard offers no switch to turn this tracking off for transactional email. The free plan also adds the unsubscribe header that some mail clients show as **Unsubscribe**. The free plan has a daily sending limit; check the current value in the dashboard.

**Email content:** responsive HTML in Portuguese or English (following the entry screen language) with a plain-text version, subject **Redefinição de senha do eduAssets** / **Reset your eduAssets password**, the brand banner embedded as an inline attachment (`cid`, no external images required), a **Set a new password** button with the full link spelled out, a box with the account, request date/time (Brasília time) and validity (30 minutes, single use), next steps, a security notice and a footer linking to the app, the website and support. With `SUPPORT_EMAIL`, replies go to support (Reply-To) instead of the `nao-responda@` sender. The banner lives in `backend/assets/email/header.jpg` in the API repository and is copied into the Docker image.

After editing `.env.production`, recreate the `api` service **with the tag of the running image** — without `EDUASSETS_IMAGE_TAG`, Compose looks for `eduassets-backend:local`, which does not exist on the VM:

```bash
cd /opt/api-eduassets
TAG=$(docker inspect eduassets-api-1 --format '{{.Config.Image}}' | cut -d: -f2)
sudo EDUASSETS_IMAGE_TAG="$TAG" docker compose -p eduassets -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  --env-file .env.production up -d --no-build --force-recreate api
curl -s https://api.eduassets.tech/auth/session-capabilities   # "passwordRecovery": true
```

Oracle Cloud blocks only outbound port 25; 465/587 work.

## 6. Nginx

Nginx accepts HTTPS connections on TCP port 443, according to the reviewed configuration bind, and forwards to the local API. Validate before reloading:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo ss -ltnp | grep -E ':(80|443)\b' || true
sudo systemctl status nginx --no-pager
```

Test locally without going through Cloudflare:

```bash
curl -vk --max-time 10 \
  --resolve api.eduassets.tech:443:127.0.0.1 \
  https://api.eduassets.tech/health
```

A `--resolve` test forces a direct origin connection and bypasses the Cloudflare proxy; it may not reproduce the trusted-proxy/client-IP chain used by normal traffic. Run it only with the reviewed Nginx/real-IP configuration and treat it as an origin test, not a complete public-path test. The public configuration keeps RFID disabled.

## 7. Firewall: incident and fix

During deployment, SYN packets reached the VM interface but the external client timed out. The API on `127.0.0.1:3000` and local Nginx returned `200`. The cause was the iptables `INPUT` chain:

```text
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
...
REJECT all ... reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
ufw-before-input ...
```

The generic `REJECT` appeared before the UFW chains, so `ufw allow 80/tcp` and `ufw allow 443/tcp` were never reached. The safe fix was to allow only new TCP connections on the public ports before the block:

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 80 \
  -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 443 \
  -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
```

Do not remove the generic `REJECT`, open port `3000`, or change `FORWARD` without evidence that Docker forwarding is blocked. Confirm the order:

```bash
sudo iptables -L INPUT -n -v --line-numbers
```

The port 80/443 rules must be above the `REJECT`. Persist only after validating access:

```bash
if command -v netfilter-persistent >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  sudo netfilter-persistent save
else
  sudo mkdir -p /etc/iptables
  sudo sh -c 'iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4'
fi
```

In addition to the host firewall, the Oracle VCN/NSG or Security List must allow TCP 80 and 443 according to the chosen origin policy. SSH must remain restricted to the administrative IP. Do not allow port 3000 or PostgreSQL.

## 8. Layered diagnosis

Check the container first:

```bash
curl -i --max-time 10 http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```

Then local Nginx:

```bash
curl -vk --max-time 10 \
  --resolve api.eduassets.tech:443:127.0.0.1 \
  https://api.eduassets.tech/health
```

Then, from an external computer, force the VM IP:

```powershell
curl.exe -vk --max-time 15 `
  --resolve api.eduassets.tech:443:<VM-PUBLIC-IP> `
  https://api.eduassets.tech/health
```

Interpretation:

- Failure on `127.0.0.1:3000`: container/API or the database path used by `/ready`.
- Local Nginx works but the external test times out: firewall, NSG/Security List, route, or public IP.
- `522`/`523`: Cloudflare cannot reach the origin; this is not yet a CORS error.
- `204` without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: preflight/CORS is still incorrect.
- `204` with the exact origin: the CORS preflight is correct.

To observe whether external traffic reaches the VM:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -ni any 'tcp port 443'
```

## 9. CORS validation

Once HTTPS is reachable, run from PowerShell:

```powershell
curl.exe -i -X OPTIONS https://api.eduassets.tech/ready `
  -H "Origin: https://app.eduassets.tech" `
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" `
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: authorization,content-type"
```

The validated deployment returned `204 No Content` and included:

```http
access-control-allow-origin: https://app.eduassets.tech
access-control-allow-methods: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE
access-control-allow-headers: authorization,content-type
```

This proves the preflight; login and business workflows must still be tested in the UI with an authorized account.

## 10. Health, logs, and continuous operation

```bash
curl -i https://api.eduassets.tech/health
curl -i https://api.eduassets.tech/ready

docker compose \
  --env-file .env.production \
  -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  logs --tail=100 api
```

`/health` checks process liveness and does not depend on PostgreSQL. `/ready` checks the Neon connection and may return `503` when the database is unavailable. The Compose health check may mark the container `unhealthy`; `restart: unless-stopped` does not restart a process solely for that state, so configure separate monitoring/alerts. The policy keeps the service running after a Docker daemon restart, provided Compose was started and the restart policy remains in place.

Monitoring has two layers, both versioned in the API repository:

- **External (GitHub Actions):** the [`uptime.yml`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/.github/workflows/uptime.yml) workflow runs every 15 minutes and executes [`public-uptime-check.sh`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/scripts/public-uptime-check.sh). It checks the API `/health` and `/ready` (`/ready` covers Neon availability), the app, the landing page, the documentation host, TLS validity for the four hosts (alert below 14 days) and the `security.txt` `Expires` field (alert below 30 days). A failed run turns red and GitHub emails the account that last changed the schedule. GitHub pauses schedules after 60 days without repository activity; re-enable it under **Actions** if that happens. The script can also be run by hand: `bash deploy/scripts/public-uptime-check.sh`. GitHub runners come from datacenter IPs: Cloudflare protections that challenge that traffic (such as **Bot Fight Mode**, which allows no exceptions on the free plan) make the HTTP checks receive `403` while TLS and `security.txt` keep passing. After any Cloudflare bot-protection change, run the workflow manually and confirm it stays green.
- **On the VM (systemd):** [`vm-health-check.sh`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/scripts/vm-health-check.sh), triggered every 5 minutes by `eduassets-healthcheck.timer`, checks disk usage (`/` and `/var/lib/docker`, 85% limit), available memory, the API container health state and the age of the newest local backup (26 h limit). If the container stays `unhealthy` for 3 consecutive checks it is restarted — something `restart: unless-stopped` does not do on its own. Results go to the journal (`journalctl -u eduassets-healthcheck`); with `HEALTH_PING_URL` set, a dead-man-switch service (for example healthchecks.io) alerts on failures or when the VM stops reporting.

Installation on the VM (once, as root, from the reviewed checkout):

```bash
cd /opt/api-eduassets
install -d -m 700 /etc/eduassets /var/lib/eduassets-health
install -m 600 deploy/systemd/healthcheck.env.example /etc/eduassets/healthcheck.env   # review the values
install -m 644 deploy/systemd/eduassets-healthcheck.service deploy/systemd/eduassets-healthcheck.timer /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now eduassets-healthcheck.timer
systemctl start eduassets-healthcheck.service && journalctl -u eduassets-healthcheck -n 20 --no-pager
```

On every run, `vm-health-check.sh` also reads the API request log (`docker logs` since the previous run, ignoring `/health` and `/ready` health-check traffic) and reports a problem when there were **at least 5 HTTP 5xx responses and they were at least 5%** of the requests in that interval (`ERROR_5XX_MIN_COUNT` and `ERROR_5XX_MAX_PERCENT` in `/etc/eduassets/healthcheck.env`). Requiring both avoids alerts for a single error during quiet periods. With `HEALTH_PING_URL`, the problem reaches the dead-man switch as `/fail`. The script also reports when the last automatic deployment (§5.1) failed.

## 11. Backup and recovery

Before migrations on an operational database, run [backup-postgres.sh](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/scripts/backup-postgres.sh) from the root of the backend repository checkout, with a protected URL compatible with `pg_dump`. For Neon PostgreSQL 18, use `pg_dump` major version 18 or newer; do not use a version 16 client against a version 18 server.

When sourcing an environment file, avoid externally duplicated quote characters. For `pg_dump`, keep a dedicated libpq URL if Prisma parameters differ. Never place real URLs in this document.

Backups must be encrypted, copied off the VM, and tested by restoring into a new empty database. An existing dump file alone does not prove recoverability.

### 11.1 Scheduled daily backup and retention

[`run-scheduled-backup.sh`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/scripts/run-scheduled-backup.sh) runs `backup-postgres.sh` followed by [`prune-backups.sh`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/scripts/prune-backups.sh). Configuration lives in `/etc/eduassets/backup.env` (mode `0600`; template in [`deploy/systemd/backup.env.example`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/systemd/backup.env.example)). Default retention keeps 7 days of local copies and 30 days in R2, and **never deletes anything** when fewer than 3 backups exist inside the window — so a broken job cannot wipe the last good copies. Optionally configure an equivalent R2 lifecycle rule as a second safeguard. With `BACKUP_PING_URL`, a dead-man switch alerts if the daily backup fails or does not happen.

```bash
cd /opt/api-eduassets
sudo install -m 600 -o ubuntu deploy/systemd/backup.env.example /etc/eduassets/backup.env   # fill in the real values
sudo install -m 644 deploy/systemd/eduassets-backup.service deploy/systemd/eduassets-backup.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now eduassets-backup.timer      # daily at 03:30 Brasília time (06:30 UTC)
sudo systemctl start eduassets-backup.service && journalctl -u eduassets-backup -n 30 --no-pager
systemctl list-timers 'eduassets-*'
```

Adjust `User=` in `eduassets-backup.service` if the account that owns `/etc/eduassets/pgpass` and the `rclone` configuration is not `ubuntu`.

### 11.2 Restore drill

[`verify-backup-restore.sh`](https://github.com/edu-assets/api-eduassets/blob/main/deploy/scripts/verify-backup-restore.sh) proves that a backup can be recovered. It runs **on the operator machine that holds the `age` private identity** (never on the VM): it downloads the newest backup from R2 (or uses `BACKUP_FILE`), decrypts it locally, restores it into a disposable PostgreSQL 18 Docker container bound to `127.0.0.1` only, checks `_prisma_migrations` (no unfinished migrations) and row counts, then destroys the container and the plaintext dump. It never connects to the production database.

```bash
export AGE_IDENTITY="$HOME/.config/eduassets/age-identity.txt"   # mode 0600
export RCLONE_SOURCE='r2:eduassets-postgres-backups/postgres'
export EXPECTED_MIGRATION='20261112130000_password_reset_tokens'  # optional: the newest migration in backend/prisma/migrations
bash deploy/scripts/verify-backup-restore.sh
```

Requirements: Docker, `age`, and `rclone` configured with read access to the bucket. Run the drill once the scheduled backup is enabled and monthly afterwards, recording the date, backup name, newest migration and row counts (no data values) in the operations log.

## 12. Deployment checks recorded on October 23, 2026

The deployment record for that date noted:

- Frontend at `app.eduassets.tech` and a separate landing page at `eduassets.tech`.
- API at `api.eduassets.tech`, with remote PostgreSQL on Neon.
- Docker API published locally on the VM, with Nginx listening on ports 80/443.
- Port 80/443 input rules positioned before the generic `REJECT`.
- External HTTPS reaching the API and CORS preflight returning the exact frontend origin.
- CSP allowing the API, hosted documentation, and official Cloudflare beacon.

This dated record is not a real-time service check.

## 13. API deployment record — October 28, 2026

The operator reported deploying API v1.0.1 at commit `14b0716110750857daa27d0e979e3bec574e39e0`, with migration `20261028173000_user_management_audit`. A 328366-byte backup was created before migration, encrypted with `age`, and listed in Cloudflare R2 bucket `eduassets-postgres-backups`; transfer completed after an automatic retry of HTTP 501. `pg_dump` 18.6 was used against Neon 18.6, with the password supplied through mode-0600 `PGPASSFILE`.

The operator's commands returned success from `/health` and `/ready` through VM loopback and `https://api.eduassets.tech`. The first Compose snapshot still showed `health: starting`; no later `healthy` state was recorded. The production object was not restored, backup scheduling/retention was not configured, and this API update did not change Nginx, firewall, or Cloudflare settings. This record is not a substitute for continuous monitoring or a recovery policy.

## 14. External check recorded on November 12, 2026

A read-only external check over the internet returned `{"status":"ok"}` from `/health` and `{"status":"ready"}` from `/ready` (HTTP 200), HTTP 200 from the app, landing page and documentation host, TLS certificates valid for 67 to 73 days and a published `security.txt`. This confirms the API v1.0.1 deployed on October 28 was healthy and connected to the database; it is not a real-time reading. From this date on, the §10 monitoring performs these checks continuously. Operational items that require action on the VM or the operator machine — enabling the backup and health-check timers, running the first restore drill and registering the optional pings — should be recorded here once done.

**VM activation — November 12, 2026 (12:24–12:30 UTC):**

- Checkout `/opt/api-eduassets` aligned with `origin/main` (`a82715d`) after the GitHub history rewrite: the tree of the deployed commit (`14b0716`) is identical to `cd1b460` in the new history (`49a0870…`), with no local changes; the old commit was kept in the local branch `backup/pre-rewrite-14b0716`. The API was neither rebuilt nor restarted and keeps running image `eduassets-backend:14b071611075` (`healthy`).
- `/etc/eduassets/backup.env` created (mode `0600`, owner `ubuntu`) with the password-free Neon *direct* URL and the destination `offsite:eduassets-postgres-backups/postgres`.
- Manual and systemd-triggered backups completed successfully (`eduassets-20261112T122849Z.dump.age` and `eduassets-20261112T122938Z.dump.age`, 334393 bytes each); R2 now holds 3 objects. The first upload attempt to R2 returns HTTP 501 and `rclone`'s automatic retry completes the transfer, as on October 28.
- `eduassets-backup.timer` (daily, 06:30 UTC) and `eduassets-healthcheck.timer` (every 5 minutes) enabled. First VM check: disk 24%, 473 MB memory available, API `healthy`, backup 0 h old — `VM health OK`.
- Still pending: the first restore drill on the operator machine (§11.2), optional dead-man-switch pings and the Cloudflare dashboard settings (§15).

**Release 1.2.0 and email — November 12, 2026 (afternoon):**

- `eduassets-deploy.timer` enabled. The automatic deployment shipped commit `6a3185d` (image `eduassets-backend:6a3185d563f2`): since the release included migration `20261112130000_password_reset_tokens`, it first took the encrypted backup (R2 upload completed after the HTTP 501 retry), applied the migration through the `migrate` service and only then recreated the API, which became `healthy`. All three timers (`eduassets-backup`, `eduassets-healthcheck`, `eduassets-deploy`) are active.
- Email configured with Brevo (§5.2): domain authenticated, branded subdomain `em`, the VM IP on the authorized-IP list and sender `nao-responda@eduassets.tech`. `/auth/session-capabilities` started reporting `passwordRecovery: true` and the test email reached `teste@eduassets.tech` (a Zoho Mail alias).
- Commit `5167d9f` (professional email template: banner, request details, security notice, footer and Reply-To) was deployed by the timer after CI; `SUPPORT_EMAIL` and `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` were added to `.env.production` and the `api` service was recreated on image `eduassets-backend:5167d9f60c84` (`healthy`). A first attempt to recreate it without `EDUASSETS_IMAGE_TAG` failed without affecting the running container; the correct command is in §5.2.
- The email button opened a "Your connection is not private" page: the tracking host `r.em.eduassets.tech` served Brevo's default certificate (`r.mailin.fr`, expired in 2024) while the branded-subdomain certificate had not been issued. Brevo issued the Let's Encrypt certificate for `r.em.eduassets.tech` at 14:02 UTC and the full flow started working. If it happens again, the fallback is removing the branded subdomain in Brevo (links go back to Brevo's default domain).
- Still pending: the first restore drill (§11.2), optional dead-man-switch pings, the remaining Cloudflare dashboard settings (§15) and the VM reboot requested by Ubuntu (*System restart required*).

**Monitoring, alerting and Cloudflare — 2026-11-12 (late afternoon):**

- **Uptime:** the first manual run failed with HTTP `403` on the five HTTP checks (TLS and `security.txt` passed) because Bot Fight Mode was on and blocked GitHub's runners. With the mode turned off, the re-run passed (18:59 UTC); the following manual and scheduled runs (19:49, 20:08 and 20:28 UTC) passed as well.
- **VM reboot** done. Afterwards `/ready` returned `{"status":"ready"}` and the 19:22 UTC health check recorded 25% disk, 625 MB available memory, API `healthy` and `VM health OK`.
- **Dead-man switch (healthchecks.io):** checks `eduassets-health` (5-minute period, 10-minute grace) and `eduassets-backup` (1-day period, 2-hour grace), with email alerts. `HEALTH_PING_URL` and `BACKUP_PING_URL` set in `/etc/eduassets/healthcheck.env` and `/etc/eduassets/backup.env` (mode `0600`). The first `HEALTH_PING_URL` value pointed to another UUID and was corrected; since then, the health check's automatic pings (POST with the `ok` result) reach the dashboard. To check the UUID without printing the whole URL: `sudo bash -c 'set -a; . /etc/eduassets/healthcheck.env; echo "${HEALTH_PING_URL:0:28}..."'`. The backup check receives its first ping with the scheduled backup on 2026-11-13.
- **R2 HTTP 501 diagnosed:** with `rclone copy -vv`, the first attempt returns `NotImplemented` (501) but the object is already stored; the retry finds the file with the same size and date and does not upload again. No data is lost. The cause was `rclone v1.60.1-DEV`, Ubuntu's 2022 package: it was replaced with the official rclone.org `.deb` (`sudo apt remove rclone` and `sudo dpkg -i rclone-current-linux-<architecture>.deb`; the configuration in `~/.config/rclone` was kept). With `rclone v1.76.0` at `/usr/bin/rclone`, the same test passed on the first attempt (`Copied (new)`, no error) at 20:41 UTC. The official `.deb` is not updated by `apt`; repeat the installation once or twice a year.
- **Cloudflare dashboard (§15):** account MFA enabled, Bot Fight Mode tested and kept off, AI Labyrinth enabled and `security.txt` also configured in the dashboard.
- **Database:** grants and RLS verified in Neon; the result is in the Data Model (section *Database grants and RLS (verified)*).
- Still pending: confirm the first scheduled backup (2026-11-13, 06:30 UTC) and the backup check's first ping, the first restore drill (§11.2) and DMARC to `p=quarantine` (from December, §15).

## 15. Cloudflare zone security

The Cloudflare Security Insights report of November 11, 2026 flagged the following for `eduassets.tech`:

| Item | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `security.txt` | Published at `https://eduassets.tech/.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116, valid until 2027-11-11; monitoring alerts 30 days before). Also configured under **Security → Settings → Security.txt** on 2026-11-12 with the same values. | When renewing `Expires`, update both the website file **and** the dashboard, keeping the values identical. |
| DMARC | Published on 2026-11-12 (Brevo's setup assistant consolidated two conflicting `_dmarc` records, `p=none` and `p=quarantine`, which made the policy invalid): `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:rua@dmarc.brevo.com,mailto:dasilva-thiago@eduassets.tech; adkim=r; aspf=r`. SPF (`include:zohomail.com`) covers Zoho; for Brevo sends, alignment comes from the `brevo1`/`brevo2._domainkey` DKIM with `d=eduassets.tech`. | Watch the aggregate reports for a few weeks; with no legitimate failures, tighten to `p=quarantine`. Keep a single `_dmarc` record. |
| Bot Fight Mode | Tested on 2026-11-12 and kept **off**: it blocked the `Uptime` workflow with HTTP `403` and allows no exceptions on the free plan. It could also block non-browser clients such as the RFID bridge (`rfid_admin_bridge.py`) when pointed at the public API. | Do not re-enable while monitoring relies on GitHub Actions. |
| AI Labyrinth | Enabled on 2026-11-12; `Uptime` kept passing. | — |
| Cloudflare account MFA | Enabled on 2026-11-12. The account signed in through GitHub and had no Cloudflare password; one was created through the **Forgot your password?** flow before enabling MFA. | Keep the recovery codes off the computer. |
| Turnstile | No widget. | Optional; only needed if a public form is added. |

These changes are made in the Cloudflare dashboard by the account owner; record the date of each one in this section.

## 16. Privacy, cookies and Google Analytics

Since 2026-11-12 the app has its own **Privacy Policy**, at `https://app.eduassets.tech/#privacidade`, opened from the link on the entry screen and from the cookie banner; item 9 of the Terms of Use points to it. The content lives in `index.html` (modal `#modal-privacy`) and in the `privacy.*` keys of `src/core/i18n/pt.json`/`en.json`. It identifies the controller, the data processed (accounts, operational records, audit trail, password recovery and technical data), guest mode, the LGPD legal bases, the providers (Cloudflare, Oracle Cloud, Neon, Cloudflare R2, Brevo, Zoho Mail, GitHub and Google Analytics), retention, cookies and browser storage, security and data-subject rights. The `eduassets.tech` website keeps its own privacy and cookie policies, limited to the landing page.

Google Analytics loads only after consent in the banner (app and website). The choice is kept in `eduassets_analytics_consent` in local storage, with a version (`CONSENT_VERSION`); refusing deletes the `_ga*` cookies. The **Cookie preferences** button (privacy policy footer in the app; footer and cookie policy on the website) reopens the banner.

When the way data is handled changes, update the policy and its "Last updated" date in the app and on the website; if the purposes of the statistics change, increment `CONSENT_VERSION` in both modules so the banner asks again. When a provider changes (for example, the email provider), update section 5 of the app policy.
